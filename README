mThe Little Library is an open source application that allows you to upload, 
store, and share creative commons licensed content across computers and 
digital devices, offline and in the cloud. This is the Beta Version. The 
Little Library was built as a peer-to-peer sharing distributed platform 
for storing/sharing Open Licensed content (videos, audio, books, notes, 
courses, and pictures) for use in educational settings around the world, 
where offline learning libraries, and automated peer-to-peer 
replication of content will hopefully help to make constructivist forms of 
learning more widespread. 

The Little Library is built on CouchDB, JQuery, and JQuery Mobile, along 
with a small PHP proxy, and uses Mikeal's CouchApp Takeout for installation. 

To try it out, just go to:
http://library.ic.tl/library/_design/takeout/install.html


Or if you don't like easy installations and you'd rather work for it,
you can install your own CouchDB and Little Library by doing the following:

1.  Download a version of CouchDB above 1.3 from 
http://www.couchbase.com/downloads/
and install it.

2.	In a Web browser, go to the following address: 
http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/index.html

3.	Click on the bottom right of the page to set up a new Admin 
(Admin Party, Fix This!), and set up a new Admin with the username and 
password of your choice (username can contain only lowercase letters and 
numbers, password should begin with a letter).

4.	Create a new database called "library".

5.	In a Web browser, go to the following address: 
http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/replicator.html 

6.	Replicate changes from: Remote Database 
http://library.ic.tl/library
(Paste this address into the box)

Replicate changes to: Local Database
library (Paste the word library into the box)

Click on the "Replicate" button.

7.	Click on "Overview" on the top left.

8.	Click on "_users".

9.	Click on the link that says "org.couchdb.user:username" (with your 
username instead of the word "username")

10.	Click "Delete Document" on the top.

11.	Log out on the bottom right.

12.	In a Web browser, go the following address: 
http://127.0.0.1:5984/library/_design/library/index.html

13.	Sign up with the same username and password you chose earlier 
(username can contain only lowercase letters and numbers, password should begin with a letter).

From there, you can add content to the different categories in your library. 
Anyone can grab content from your library with just your online database URL
(you'll find this URL on the about.html page in your library), and can share
content with you by sharing their URL. But only you can edit your content. You
can use the library to sync two or more accounts as well. Just go to sync from someone
else's library (set to continuous sync), and ask them sync from yours (set to 
continuous sync). Now if either of you make any changes to your online or offline
libraries, the other libraries will be synced as soon as all libraries are 
connected via the internet again. If there is a conflict between two different
updates, the earliest update will win (and the other will be saved as a previous
version). 

If you want to build your own Little Library based application, feel free to. All of
the software is released under MIT, Apache 2.0, and/or GPL licenses. 

You'll just need to change the variables in the top of the library.js file (lines 10, 11, 12
& 13), and several variables in the library.php file (lines 15, 16, 21, 83 & 84). Then you'll 
put library.php onto a server, set up a couchdb online somewhere and locally. On your 
couchdb, you can either just replicate with The Little Library template at 
library.ic.tl/library, or you can upload all of these files (other than library.php) into a 
design document and build away (check out the validate_doc_update, views, etc. in the library.ic.tl/librar/_design/library document to see how this is currently implemented).
